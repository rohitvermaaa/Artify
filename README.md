This is a simple Android paint app built using Kotlin and Canvas for drawing. The app provides various features for drawing, including choosing different brush stroke sizes and colors, drawing on top of images from the gallery, undo functionality, and saving/sharing the created images.

## Features

- **Brush Stroke/Size:** This feature allows users to personalize their drawing experience by selecting from a range of brush stroke sizes. Whether they prefer fine details or bold strokes, users can adjust the brush size to suit their artistic vision.
- **Color Selection:** With the color selection feature, users have the freedom to express their creativity by choosing from a diverse palette of colors. Whether they're sketching, painting, or annotating, users can easily switch between colors to achieve the desired effect.
